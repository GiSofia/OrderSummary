## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned to work with measures

```css
@media(max-width: 375px){
    .container-card{
        background-image: url('./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg');
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: none;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about CSS, to know its properties very well, as well as to practice the Grid, Flexbox and screen measurements.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This website helped me a lot with the CSS grid theme, I highly recommend it.

## Acknowledgments

I did this challenge alone, without anyone's help, more than the resources I occupied.
